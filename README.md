## <a name="design-choices">Design Choices</a>

### Fonts
- I used [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for the body and after some deliberation and feeedback from some friends that tested the website I decided to use [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) for all the headings and navbar items.


### Colours
 


### Icons
- The icons that I used in this project were provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). I decided to use icons as they offer a pleasant visual aide to the site, also users tend to know that icons usually work as buttons.

## <a name="database-model">Database Model</a>
